        <p class="summary" style="color:#4f4f4f">
            The purpose of Galaga is to be able to fight off the enemy bugs from<br>
            destroying your starship. With limited amount of bullets and an increasing<br>
            rate of enemy bugs appearing, you must keep fighting until you either<br>
            run out of bullets or destroy your ship. We focused on using the scripts<br>
            that sent messages out to other sprites and the variable "game_over", which<br>
            could be triggered in countless ways from losing all the bullets, running<br>
            into an enemy, or losing all your lives. These scripts allow the use of<br>
            the final sprite to trigger both the notification that the game has to<br>
            players and the "stop" script that concludes the game, thus the player has<br>
            to click the green flag to restart the game. We encountered glitches from<br>
            the Scratch itself with the positions of the axes being offset, finding<br>
            scripts that overlapped each other causing multiple triggers, and the<br>
            best method to clean the scripts to allow us to see the progress and the<br>
            necessary fixes to our game.

        <p class="summary" style="color:#4f4f4f">
            Our story begins with a teenage boy, William, who goes to school to<br>
            find a girl that he loves  and tries to kiss her, but things completely<br>
            go wrong. He finds himself kidnapped and placed in an insane asylum where<br>
            he must find a way out. He goes through different obstacles and has<br>
            to make quick decisions in order to survive from killing to going through<br>
            shady hallways.
        </p>
        <p class="summary" style="color=#4f4f4f">
            <b>a)</b> We looked into "meme"ing up our project and finding the best ways to<br>
            make the story as creative, whacky, and logical as possible. We had to<br>
            understand how Python works and the different methods of organization to<br>
            allow the story to start and move the plot correctly.<br><br>
            <b>b)</b> After having our lesson on organizing our story in Python, we only had<br>
            the problem of allowing the story to start when we press running instead of<br>
            typing out "introduction()". To solve this problem, we learned to place the<br>
            first command to start the story at the end, so when the program runs, the first<br>
            command it reads automatically is "introduction()", instead of the user having<br>
            to define it.<br><br>
            <b>c)</b> I liked this project since it taught me how to organize and label the<br>
            different commands on my project more carefully. I disliked the creative<br>
            portion of the project, but that is also why the project is able to move<br>
            forward.<br><br>
            <b>d)</b> I liked Phillip's "Cynical". The story was very concise and short,<br>
            yet the plot of the story was very interesting and you felt that any actions<br>
            you chose morally affected how you perceive of yourself.<br><br>
            <b>e)</b> I would change my story to make it more serious and much darker<br>
            since some of the class favorites were very dark yet intriguing to play.
